You’ll work with stakeholders to plan requirements, identify risks, manage project schedules, and communicate clearly with cross-functional partners across the company.

As part of our efforts to build a Google for everyone, we build diversity, equity, and inclusion into our work and we aim to cultivate a sense of belonging throughout the company.

Imagine looking through a magic window, and through that window, you see another person, life-size and in three-dimensions. As part of the Project Starline team, you'll work with researchers and engineers in a fast-paced product-oriented environment. Our teams collaborate closely with Google Workspace and Research teams. Your contributions will have an impact on the future of communications with Google products. You will apply technology to solve that really important problem that we often want to be together and we can’t.

"Operations Technical Project Manager, Customer Success","Operations Technical Project Manager, Customer Success",Square,May,2024,"Company Description

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

Clinical Project Manager,Clinical Project Manager,Lightship,May,2024,"Overview

Lightship is a clinical trials service provider leading in increasing access and choice in taking part in research to improve equity for all. We design and conduct studies in partnership with biopharmaceutical companies to accelerate bringing new therapies to market. Our approach is to engage people where they are and support them across their journey in a clinical trial, from first contact to study completion. We work to make it easy, convenient, and safe for people to take part by offering visits in clinic, at home, using our mobile research units, and digital health tools. By transforming the way, we conduct clinical research, we can decrease study timelines and reduce dropouts to accelerate development of better therapies.

A successful candidate will possess a willingness and desire to work independently without significant supervision. Lightship expects each individual to anchor their availability in the standard operating hours for their geographic location, however, true to our values of inclusion and flexibility, this role, along with all others at Lightship, may be asked to flex work hours to accommodate US West Coast, US East Coast, and UK-based time zones, based on business need. In practice, this may translate to days that have a slightly earlier start or evenings that have a slightly later end. Culturally, we aim to balance the ability to operate across time zones with respect for each individual's daily life.
