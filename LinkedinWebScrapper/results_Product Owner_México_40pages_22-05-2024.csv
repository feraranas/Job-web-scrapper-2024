CRIO (Clinical Research IO) is a health tech company helping pharma, biotech, research sites, and academic research centers streamline regulatory workflows with one system and a single source of clinical data capture. Our modules allow sites to capture data electronically in real-time, providing data managers and monitors with enhanced transparency, and enabling remote monitoring by sponsors and CROs.

CRIO's eSource and CTMS system is a leading, modern, enterprise platform built for clinical research sites. Since CRIO's launch in 2016, CRIO has established the leading brand position in eSource and has won close to 50% of the emerging class of enterprise-grade site networks, many of whom are backed by institutional investors such as VC, PE and corporations. CRIO has achieved the attached metrics, all with little to no serious outbound sales or marketing.

In 2022, CRIO released its Reviewer product, a separate application that allows third parties to review, query, lock, medical code and extract source data collected in eSource. Reviewer is a flexible application that CRIO plans to commercialize with its own site networks, with third party vendors (e.g., overnight EDC entry services), and with sponsors and CRO's as either a remote monitoring tool OR a full EDC solution. This innovative architecture is truly groundbreaking, and offers a new vision for how sponsors and CRO's can drive quality and efficiency.
