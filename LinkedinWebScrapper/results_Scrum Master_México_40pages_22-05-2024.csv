Inspiration Note: You are the magic that brings concepts to life, guiding a team in developing a revolutionary app that not only brings people closer to nature but also has immense potential to significantly impact public health and resilience of cities.
Minimum Qualifications: Bachelor's / Master's degree
Minimum Experience: 2+ years of professional experience, preferably with a background in software development or project management.
Availability: Volunteer hours: 5-21 hours per week
Project Duration: 6-12 months (Ongoing)
Project Overview - Nature Counter:
Unpaid, virtual volunteer role. This is not a financially compensated position.
Imagine a world where technology is harnessed to bring us closer to nature, where a simple app becomes an instrument of personal and societal well-being. As the Scrum Master for the Nature Counter project, you're on a journey to make this vision a reality.
The project is grounded in the belief that regular immersion in nature - 120 minutes a week, to be precise - should be a part of public health recommendations for urban dwellers. This nature dosage isn't arbitrary; it is associated with a myriad of health benefits, including the prevention of over a hundred diseases.
We're developing Nature Counter, an app that helps people track their time in nature, much like a fitness tracker. Our aim is to encourage urban residents to increase their time spent in nature, thus improving their health and well-being, and ultimately transforming our cities into healthier and happier habitats.
Essential Tasks:
Serving as the Scrum Master, guiding both technical and non-functional activities managed in an Agile manner.
Facilitating Agile ceremonies, establishing best practices, and implementing appropriate tools.
Assisting the team in achieving sprint goals by reinforcing good Scrum principles and practices, and helping the team improve continuously.
Eliminating impediments and removing blockers so the team can stay focused on their objectives.
Skills & Competencies:
At least a year of Scrum Master experience leading a software development or engineering team.
CSM or other Agile certifications are beneficial.
Proven success in applying Agile concepts and techniques to drive projects to completion.
Hands-on experience with Agile tools (preferred, not required).
About the Research:
Our research delves into the link between access to nature and public health. Evidence shows that exposure to nature can decrease depression, increase mindfulness, and reduce the spread of misinformation. We aim to democratize access to nature and thereby improve mental health and resilience of cities. Our research also involves experimenting with nature-immersion interventions, offering organizations a chance to gauge how increasing 'nature doses' can improve productivity and employee wellbeing.
Aims & Approach:
Our multi-pronged, inclusive, and collaborative approach aims to bridge the gap between research and its application. By providing organizations with the tools and insights to realize the benefits of nature immersion, we hope to foster an environment that values and preserves nature. We anticipate collecting data from GPS, surveys, biometric wearables, and various institutional records to evaluate the effects of nature immersion on productivity and health.
Persuasion and Misinformation:
In addition, our project also tackles the widespread issue of misinformation. We propose to explore how exposure to nature, which has been associated with improved cognitive functioning, self-esteem, and decreased stress levels, can bolster resistance to misinformation.
Join us on this exciting journey to create a healthier, greener world. Let's make our cities breathe with nature, one app at a time.
This is an unpaid, virtual volunteer role."
