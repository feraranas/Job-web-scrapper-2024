Change Requests will be used when additional scope, schedule, or cost is needed, and the project manager will facilitate documenting the change and escalating to leadership as appropriate.

"Operations Technical Project Manager, Customer Success","Operations Technical Project Manager, Customer Success",Square,May,2024,"Company Description

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

Use your understanding of software development processes to identify dependencies, ""long poles,"" ""blockers,"" and execution risks and develop mitigation strategies
Communicate developments, updates, project health, and problems, and manage expectations of all stakeholders – both technical and non-technical

Experience managing trade-offs while running multiple projects given specific constraints, often with competing resources
The ability to understand and deal well with rapid development cycles and to remain flexible in the face of uncertainty
Experience with prioritization and continuous optimization. You can discern the urgency and importance of work. You find creative ways to use the full potential of our existing tools and advocate for novel solutions
