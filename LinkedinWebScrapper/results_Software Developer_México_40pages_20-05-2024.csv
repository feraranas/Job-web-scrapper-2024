"Software Engineer, Developer Productivity","Software Engineer, Developer Productivity",Stripe,May,2024,"Build the infrastructure powering economic growth

Stripe’s infrastructure powers businesses all over the world. We process payments, run marketplaces, detect fraud, help entrepreneurs start an internet business from anywhere in the world, build world-class developer-friendly APIs, and more. If you’re an infrastructure engineer here, you’ll get to build the systems that power our products.

The Developer Productivity group is responsible for making Stripe’s internal developers happy and productive. We work on tools, processes, and code refactoring to accelerate Stripe engineering as Stripe scales. Within Developer Productivity, the Build Experience team works to make sure that Stripe developers’ interactions with our build system are reliable, fast, and easy to use. Our system should be powerful and fast enough to support all our users, but flexible enough to handle all use cases: low-latency microservices, computing on enormous data pipelines, or constructing sophisticated machine learning models.

We’re looking for people with a strong background in and interest in building language processing tools and language specific developer tools. The ideal candidate will have a mix of technical expertise in language processing or build systems, a passion for solving developer experience problems, and a pragmatic ability to ship results iteratively.

You Will

Work with a team of technically sophisticated engineers who make developer experience their first priority.
Solve problems for fellow Stripe engineers by understanding their needs and coming up with both short term workarounds and long term solutions.
Use both qualitative and quantitative metrics to determine priorities and measure effectiveness.
Deliver practical, useful, and reliable tools, processes, and code refactorings to Stripe engineers.
Improve and maintain the Bazel build infrastructure for our repository.
Work with stakeholders across Stripe to balance and accommodate competing needs.


You may be a fit for this role if you:

Are passionate about developer experience.
Are results driven and pragmatic.
Thrive in a collaborative and diverse environment involving different stakeholders and subject matter experts.
Enjoy and have experience building developer productivity tooling, especially working with large scale CI/CD systems. Experience with build tools like Bazel is great, but not required.
Comfortable with at least 1 of the following (Scala, Java, Python, Go), and open to working with others.


You Might Work On

Changing how Stripe engineers write, share, review, and merge code through education, automated tooling, new infrastructure, and new processes.
Building systems to ensure Stripe developers’ builds are always green, and reacting quickly if something goes wrong.
Constructing better tooling and metrics so that we, and our users, understand the health of our systems.
Performance engineering to make our CI builds as fast as possible and make sure they stay that way.


It’s not expected that any single candidate would have expertise across all of these areas. For instance, we have wonderful team members who are really focused on their customers’ needs and building amazing user experiences, but didn’t come in with as much systems knowledge.

What’s it like to work at Stripe?

Stripe is helping the internet fulfill its potential as a platform for economic progress by building software tools that accelerate global economic access and technological development. Stripe makes it easy to start, run and scale an internet business from anywhere in the world.

Stripe is, at its heart, an engineering company. To provide a missing pillar of core internet infrastructure, we hire people with a broad set of technical skills (and from a wide variety of backgrounds) who are ready to take on some of the most challenging problems in the industry – from reliably handling 100M API requests per day, to building adaptive machine learning as a result of years of data science and infrastructure work, and enabling entrepreneurs worldwide to start a global internet business.

We look at Stripe as a constant work in progress and the same is true of our people; for all of us, we believe the best is yet to come. We’re here to support each other in our curiosity and creativity – which we pursue through thoughtful discussion and knowledge-sharing among a diverse set of peers and colleagues.We encourage all engineers to transition teams once every year and a half and also take on short-term projects with other teams across Stripe. This enables engineers to learn how different parts of Stripe work while also establishing stronger ties and cross-pollination between groups.We contribute to existing open-source projects and the people working on them, and we release several tools as open-source.

We want to work in a company of warm, inclusive people who treat their colleagues exceptionally well. The kind of people who are committed to going out of their way to help other Stripes in the short-term and pushing them to improve over the long-term (by helping them to get better at what they do).

We’re a highly cross-functional organization and view that as part of the fun: we design our space to encourage as much collaboration as possible. We have long tables in the kitchen for a reason (to enable everyone to meet new people and learn from them). We also have a culture of transparency that we carry through to email communication, ensuring that Stripes all around the world have the information they need to make good local decisions. In both our products and our people, we aim to reflect, represent and advocate for all of our users, globally. Our users transcend geography, culture and language; what we share, collectively, is a drive to create a fairer, more economically interconnected world.

Hybrid work at Stripe

This role is available either in an office or a remote location (typically, 35+ miles or 56+ km from a Stripe office).

Office-assigned Stripes spend at least 50% of the time in a given month in their local office or with users. This hits a balance between bringing people together for in-person collaboration and learning from each other, while supporting flexibility about how to do this in a way that makes sense for individuals and their teams.

A remote location, in most cases, is defined as being 35 miles (56 kilometers) or more from one of our offices. While you would be welcome to come into the office for team/business meetings, on-sites, meet-ups, and events, our expectation is you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location where you currently or plan to live.

Pay and benefits

The annual US base salary range for this role is $150,500 - $225,700. For sales roles, the range provided is the role’s On Target Earnings (""OTE"") range, meaning that the range includes both the sales commissions/sales bonuses target and annual base salary for the role. This salary range may be inclusive of several career levels at Stripe and will be narrowed during the interview process based on a number of factors, including the candidate’s experience, qualifications, and location. Applicants interested in this role and who are not located in the US may request the annual salary range for their location during the interview process.

Additional benefits for this role may include: equity, company bonus or sales commissions/bonuses; 401(k) plan; medical, dental, and vision benefits; and wellness stipends."
