Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.

As a global company, Netflix’s customers come from diverse backgrounds. And each of these backgrounds allow them to experience joy from Netflix in their own unique way. Ultimately, this joy is rooted in our customers’ ability to trust Netflix. At Netflix, we earn this trust through our actions every day.

You have familiarity with consumer product security principles and best practices, and have developed and driven security initiatives such as DDoS and fraud prevention, to name a few

You will have the opportunity to facilitate impactful security work for the Netflix business and engineering ecosystem.
You will be working with an industry leading security team with many opportunities to improve existing projects and identify new ones.
You will have the opportunity to research new ideas and share them across the community.
You enjoy learning and working closely with domain experts in diverse areas such as microservices architecture, data science and engineering, content delivery networks, and a production studio.
