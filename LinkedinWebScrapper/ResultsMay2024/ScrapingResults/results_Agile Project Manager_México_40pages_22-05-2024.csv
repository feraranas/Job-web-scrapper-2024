The IT Project Manager will lead a cross-functional team to ensure effective project delivery via continuous management of scope, schedule, and budget.

*Scope/Planning:
The IT Project Manager is responsible for working with key business and technology leaders to confirm clear definitions of (high-level) scope, confirm resource/team requirements, and for building a feasible project roadmap (timeline) to accommodate delivery. The IT PM will facilitate conversation to ensure that iterative delivery is achieved where possible (focus on MVP vs a longer-term roadmap) and will ensure effective definition and communication of delivery expectations with the team and with key stakeholders. The IT PM will facilitate cross-team planning and collaboration sessions to ensure that all dependencies are clearly identified and factored into the project delivery schedule.

The IT PM will produce a weekly status report that indicates key accomplishments and milestones, will be responsible for articulating issues and risks, and will ensure adequate escalation to closure. Change Requests will be used when additional scope, schedule, or cost is needed, and the project manager will facilitate documenting the change and escalating to leadership as appropriate.

*Team Engagement:
The IT PM will engage all resources necessary to ensure that all pieces of scope and interdependencies are effectively managed. This may include working directly with specific shared resources while also coordinating closely with Scrum Team leadership (Scrum Masters/Pos) where appropriate to ensure that team backlogs are appropriately prioritized and aligned with project objectives.

*Communication:
The IT PM will work closely with both technical and business leadership to ensure that the project is well-defined, all team members are properly aligned, and that status and major milestones are clearly articulated. The IT PM must build effective relationships both “up and down” the organization to ensure trust and confidence in the team’s ability to deliver on commitments.

*Responsibilities of the IT Project Manager:
Lead a cross-functional team to achieve project requirements, deadlines, and schedules
Identify and resolve project issues
Prepare project status reports
Coordination of change requests
Use technology to ensure all parties are informed on schedule and budget
