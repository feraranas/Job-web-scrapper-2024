Learning Business Consultant for a Business Consulting and Services Company,Learning Business Consultant for a Business Consulting and Services Company,Remotivate,May,2024,"Location: United States

Salary: $85k-$120k / year

Hello, Consultants!

At Tagoras (pronounced tah-GOR-us), we have more than 15 years of experience serving the global market for adult lifelong learning, continuing education, and professional development. We advise learning businesses on how to maximize their reach, revenue, and impact. While organized as a for-profit company, Tagoras is mission-driven. Learning businesses play a vital role in society, and we believe deeply in the power of learning to transform individuals, organizations, and communities.

What is a learning business? Learning businesses are market-facing providers of learning. They create learning experiences and sell them to adult lifelong learners. They have to generate revenue, and most must generate a profit. So they are businesses, and they are learning providers. Learning businesses differ from corporate L&D and higher education degree programs. They include trade and professional associations; academic professional, continuing, and online education (PCO) units; and training firms.

Historically, our consulting clients have been associations that offer lifelong learning, continuing education, professional development, workforce development, and/or credentialing programs. We have begun expanding our focus to also include PCO units and training firms. We do not consult with corporate training departments, academic degree programs, or K-12 education providers.

Consulting work is currently performed by the director of consulting services with support from other Tagoras staff members and, as needed, outside contractors. The Consultant selected for this position will be a full-time member of the consulting team and will report to and work closely with the director of consulting services. The main areas this candidate will focus on include market assessment, strategy formulation, and technology selection. While primarily focused on the delivery of consulting services, the consultant is also expected to help secure consulting business.

NOTE: This is a full-time remote position that will start around September/October.

Requirements

We are looking for a Business Consultant specifically with these requirements:

Excellent written and verbal communication skills
A minimum of 7 years of experience working in or for marketing-facing learning businesses (strong preference for experience with associations, PCO units, or commercial training firms)
Proven experience in leading complex consulting projects from start to finish
Expertise in both quantitative and qualitative research, with strong data collection and analysis skills
Knowledge of diverse business areas, including strategy, marketing, technology, training, education, and events
Outstanding interpersonal and relationship-building skills
Proficient in financial analysis, capable of generating profit-and-loss statements, and other basic financial documents
Demonstrated experience in project management, including the ability to deliver on complex projects and manage multiple complex projects simultaneously
Familiarity with common business software, including Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel
Experience in market research, including collaborative survey design, as well as analysis that generates actionable recommendations for clients
Proficiency with project management tools and software, databases, and business intelligence tools (e.g., Qualtrics, Monday.com)
Ability to create and refine efficient systems at both personal and company-wide levels
Comfortable with and available for occasional business travel (e.g., for client work, industry events, and company meetings)

Your responsibilities will include (but are not limited to):

Consulting Services (Approximately 80%)

Lead and support solo or team-based consulting projects, ensuring that the outputs from our work fulfill the stated goals of each project and meet or exceed client expectations
Lead and/or support multiple client projects simultaneously

Conduct research using a range of quantitative and qualitative methods, including but not limited to surveys, interviews, focus groups, internet searches, and the review of documents and websites
Analyze and synthesize complex information gathered from the above activities into clear takeaways and recommendations
Create work products that add demonstrable client value, including needs analysis summaries, competitive analysis reports, personas, product and program positioning reviews, pro forma budgets, financial scenarios, pricing analysis, and other recommendations
Clearly and concisely present recommendations and work products to client stakeholders in the manner agreed upon with the client (e.g., a slide deck and verbal presentation)
In conducting the above activities, ensure that the timeline and milestones for the project are clearly understood and agreed to by the client, and that all deadlines are met.
