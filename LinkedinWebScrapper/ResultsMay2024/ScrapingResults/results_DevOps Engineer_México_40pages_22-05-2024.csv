DevOps Engineer,DevOps Engineer,Elevar,April,2024,"About Elevar

Elevar, recently acquired by Buxton, is a leading SaaS company empowering online merchants to build a robust data foundation. We simplify server-side event tracking, providing merchants with actionable insights to fuel smarter decisions, accelerate growth, and achieve their goals. This exciting acquisition combines Elevar's expertise in online analytics with Buxton's retail analytics prowess, creating a powerhouse in the industry.

About The Role

Join our dynamic team of 4 engineers as a DevOps Engineer and play a pivotal role in scaling our application infrastructure. You'll focus on infrastructure, monitoring, and delivery, empowering your fellow engineers to focus on cutting-edge product development. We utilize serverless functions, Kubernetes, CloudSQL, Redis (Memorystore), and Dataflow cloud services on the Google Cloud Platform. Our application utilizes Typescript, React, Node, and Python technologies.

About Our App

Our app is split into two pieces: a user-facing app and a data pipeline.

The user-facing app is a React app that uses a Python backend (API first). It provides our customers with the ability to manage their accounts, configure their tracking, and view reports
The data pipeline is made up of serverless functions that receive thousands of hits per second. It enriches, filters, and transforms our merchants' data into payloads that various marketing channels can ingest. This will be the primary focus of this role.


What You'll Do

Collaborating with a fully remote team to seamlessly scale our application
Championing developer experience (DX) by implementing initiatives like ephemeral environments, automated tasks, and streamlined deployments
Optimizing infrastructure by identifying bottlenecks, implementing security initiatives, selecting optimal cloud services, and minimizing costs
Provisioning infrastructure, migrating from manually configurationed services to Infrastructure as Code (IAC)
Monitoring systems, conducting load testing, and contributing to product roadmaps with an infrastructure-centric lens.


How We Work

Our workload is divided into releases that vary in length depending on the work contained in each release. Most of our releases take about a month to complete
Each release includes a maintenance cycle where app improvements and refactors take place
The release is a time of focus. Distractions are limited during this time
Our application is all contained in a monorepo so that types and logic can be shared across workspaces

TLDR

We are a small team looking for our first DevOps team member. We've kept our infrastructure in check up to this point (no big mess!), but our minds are occupied with product-related enhancements and we need someone solely focused on infrastructure. We have a wishlist of DX items!

We deal with a high volume of data through our app. We use serverless and big data services to handle this.

Requirements

Qualifications

3+ years of experience in cloud services
2+ years of experience in Google Cloud Platform
Familiarity with high-throughput systems and/or data pipelines
Ability to work in a unix environment
Open and transparent communication
US Resource with the ability to work preferably in/around the EST time zone
This job requires US work authorization


Preferred Qualifications

Experience automating ephemeral environment creation that relies on cloud services
Experience with proxying via Cloudflare and using Edge workers
Experience with data engineering (Batch vs streaming processors, BigQuery, etc)
Terraform experience


Benefits

This is a fully remote role. Although Elevar has team members all over the world, the preferred location/time zone for this position is EST to best collaborate with other members of the immediate team.

Why Elevar?

A targeted base salary range of $100,000 to $120,000 and bonus eligible
Comprehensive benefits package effective the first day of the month following hire date with several company-paid offerings
Quarterly enrollment 401(k) with 50% company match up to employee's 6% contribution, vested in only 3 years
Front-loaded PTO and 9 paid holidays
A commitment to diversity, inclusion, and belonging

Employment is contingent upon the successful completion of a background check, as we are dedicated to providing a safe and secure work environment for all Elevar and Buxton Company, LLC stakeholders.
