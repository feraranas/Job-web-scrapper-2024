In 1951 SF Fire Credit Union first opened its doors from a modest 10′ × 15′ office space in 17 Engine. It was from those humble beginnings—where everyone pitched in to help one another in their community—that the organization forged its way of business forever. Today, the San Francisco-based credit union has grown to $1.7B in assets and a membership that extends from the regional firefighters we trace our roots back to throughout our many neighbors in San Francisco, San Mateo, and Marin Counties.
