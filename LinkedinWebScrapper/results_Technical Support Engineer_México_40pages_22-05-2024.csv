Where we Work

OneTrust embraces a hybrid working model. Our Working@ OneTrust initiative is our way of clarifying where we hire, how we work together, and where we’re located in that hybrid model.

The underlying “why” for Working@ is that we are intentional about the culture that we want to create together. That includes bringing teams together, in-person, throughout the year to collaborate, build connections, learn from each other, and celebrate our wins to Finish Stronger.

We are committed to a flexible approach informed by a set of guiding principles. You’ll see that reflected in our worker designations: “Office-flex” and “Location-flex”.

Office-flex: Like a traditional hybrid model, OneTrust “Office-flex” employees may be asked to work in an office periodically if they are within a commutable distance to a OneTrust office. This includes coming into the office for our Company Kickoff, Company All Hands, and other larger company events. Beyond that, we give our leaders and teams the flexibility to set additional guidelines based on the nature of your role.
Location-flex: Similar to other companies’ remote policies, for OneTrust “Location-flex"" roles, you will primarily work from your home office location. However, you may be required to travel to our OneTrust offices or customer sites periodically based on the nature of your role.

Each role may have specific requirements, so we encourage you to verify the location of the role with your recruiter during your first interview.

Benefits

As an employee at OneTrust, you will be part of the OneTeam. That means you’ll receive support physically, mentally, and emotionally so that you can do your best work both in and out of the office.

In Technical Support, our vision is to delight customers with speedy responses using a high level of knowledge and a personalized experience. As a Support Specialist, you are responsible for responding to and resolving customer support cases. The team adheres to a touch-and-hold Support model operating from a single global queue. The breadth of product knowledge you will obtain in this role is unsurpassed. While you will own the entire case lifecycle, you are also granted access to Subject Matter Experts throughout the organization. Note that we resolve every case with a knowledge article, making it easy for customers to find answers to their questions without opening a case. There will be times when existing literature does not address your case, so you will craft a new knowledge article to help your customer resolve their case.

Our team metrics highlight our industry leadership, notably First Response Time of 2.3 hours and Customer Satisfaction scores averaging 4.8 on a scale of 5.0. In Technical Support, we have a pre-defined career track that recognizes your achievements and rewards you for your contributions.

Case Management - We do not follow a tiered support structure; you will own each case from Opening to Resolution. You will quickly learn to troubleshoot and resolve cases across all Duetto products by relying on Training, Playbooks, Knowledge, and Peers.
Escalations - You will document product defects (using written text and video content) for escalation to R&D. You must be able to articulate Expected Behavior, Actual Behavior, and Repro Steps to Engineering.
Once you have been onboarded for one year and have become an independent contributor, you may be eligible for promotion to Senior Specialist. Senior Specialists have the following added responsibilities: peer review of knowledge articles, peer review of case escalations, and system monitoring (using tools such as sentry.io, sumologic.com, etc.)

Client-Centered Approach and Professional Orientation
Self-driven, motivated over-achievers will fit well with our team culture
Good team player, flexible and a positive attitude

It's time to build.

We’re making buildings cheaper and easier to build by transforming the way commercial construction companies buy their materials. Join us.

Founded in 2018, Kojo is now one of the fastest-growing construction technology companies in the world. Construction accounts for $10 trillion in global spend annually and we can’t live without its output - our roads, schools, hospitals, and offices. Despite this, there’s been very little innovation over the past 70 years in how materials - which constitute up to 40% of project costs - are bought and sold. This is our opportunity.

We are growing our Support Team to continue to better serve our customers! The Technical Support Specialist will be responsible for providing Tier 1 and 2 chat and email technical support to our customers. This role will work closely with Support, Product, and Engineering to resolve emergent issues and improve our overall Customer experience and Customer satisfaction.

Responding to bugs both proactively and reactively by creating test case scenarios to be used in QA testing
Providing input into developing and modifying technical support systems to meet customer and internal needs
Identifying workarounds, workflows, and new features for qualified customers to ensure that they are getting the most value out of their partnership with Kojo
Collecting and dispensing customer feedback effectively to Support, Customer Success, Product and Engineering teams
Acting as a brand ambassador for Kojo, providing world-class service and education to our customers

About You:

The ability to quickly adapt to advancing technologies and process changes is essential, as is the ability to work both independently and as part of a team. Familiarity with the construction industry, and a previous role in the construction industry, is a huge plus!

What you’ve accomplished:

3+ years working in a customer-facing role, preferably in SaaS, software, or technology-based environment
1+ years of tier 2 technical support, an IT-related role, or a QA testing role
Track record of success working in a fast-paced environment and demonstrating a high sense of urgency
Excellent network analysis fundamentals and robust troubleshooting skills, as well as experience with Jira and ReTool
Experience testing the different platforms we support (web/iOS/Android), different types of network environments, and on mobile simulators
Ability to collect and provide useful metrics on customer reports so product and engineering can take action on them
Deep understanding of the user experience and the ability to resolve customer support requests in thoughtful and creative ways
Effective written communication, expressing ideas and opinions to varied audiences
