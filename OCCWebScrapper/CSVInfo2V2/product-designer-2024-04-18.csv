Industry disruptors like Bungalow, Found, Hims and Hers, Homebound, OpenStore, and Replicant all started at Atomic along with dozens more. Atomic was founded in 2012 by serial entrepreneur Jack Abraham and is headquartered in Miami and San Francisco with a distributed team across North America.

Company Overview:

Point-of-sale systems have remained relatively stagnant over the past two decades, with widely used platforms such as Square and Clover providing straightforward functionality suitable for many industries: customers walk in, swipe their cards, and walk out. However, this simplicity falls short when it comes to meeting the unique needs of specialized industries. Recognizing this gap, our company was established to address the payment processing challenges faced by specialized sectors by seamlessly integrating payment solutions into their existing tools. Our innovative approach has garnered strong market validation, evidenced by our current customer base of five entities to join our early pilot. In light of our success, we are now in search of a passionate and driven Senior Product Designer to join our team and play a crucial role in launching the first version of our product.

After closing a fresh round of funding, we have an internal team of Product Managers and Engineers working on V1 of the Product and are now looking to make our first Product Design hire.

As the Senior member of the Design team, you'll play an instrumental part in bringing the first version of our product to market and establishing the foundation for future growth. It's an opportunity to join a company still in its infancy and create an elegant solution that both delights end users and unlocks tremendous value for end users.

What You'll Do:
Lead the design of the platform's MVP.
Design intuitive and efficient user interfaces, wireframes, and prototypes that address and simplify complex financial scenarios.
Conduct user research to gather insights and feedback, and translate them into actionable design improvements.
Utilize data-driven insights to inform design decisions, focusing on user retention, interaction, and engagement.
Prototype and iterate on AI-powered features that transform unstructured text into structured financial data.
Collaborate with product managers, engineers, and stakeholders to define and refine the user experience.


What You'll Bring:
You can distill complex financial concepts into simple, intuitive and easy-to-understand visualizations.
